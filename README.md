# Portfolio (static)

This is a small static portfolio scaffold. Files:

- `index.html` — main page with sections: Home, About, Projects, Contact
- `styles.css` — simple responsive styles
- `script.js` — tiny JS to set the year and handle contact form demo

How to use:
1. Open `index.html` in a browser to preview.
2. Replace "Your Name" and the placeholder text with your real info.
3. Replace project cards with links/screenshots to your projects.
4. To receive real messages, either wire the form to an API (Formspree, Netlify Forms, or your backend) or change the contact link to mailto.

Deploy:
- You can deploy this as a static site using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

Feedback / next steps:
- Add images, project detail pages, accessibility improvements, and meta tags for SEO.
